# storeBackEnd

This is a project that is a backend for an online store based around books.

To set upt the file, you will also need to add a .env file with the following variables. Full disclosure, none of these are the words that I use in my personal file, they only represent what you need to run the project.

The running port for backend is 3000.
Please run npm init -y and npm install to set up the project.
